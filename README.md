**RICARDO DEFENSE,** Troy, MI / Goleta, CA. (1997 – Aug 2018)

Recently, _Control Point Corporation_ was purchased by Ricardo Defense Incorporated.  In the nearly 22 years at CPC/RDI I have held a variety of positions including, but not limited to:

- Senior Principal Engineer
- Senior Director of Information Systems (aka CTO) – Eliminated due to acquisition
- Chief Software Engineer/Software Engineering Manager – Eliminated due to acquisition
- Director of Product Development (R&amp;D) and Project Manager

For the past 9 years, I have been solely responsible for bringing new technology into the business, refining it&#39;s use with our customer base, and instructing engineers/developers on its use. The latest example being the introduction of the use of web components and the Google Polymer framework. Starting with Polymer 0.5, I began a road map that would introduce the use of web components into our products starting with the release of Polymer 1.0 and developed a roadmap to Polymer 3.0.

Although I spent many years at the Senior Director level, I was also an individual contributor on many projects. I was the primary developer for several projects using frameworks I had personally designed and developed to integrate web components (Polymer), web services (C#/Java/NodeJS) and datastores (SQLite, MSSQL). I&#39;ve brought our web products to the desktop by leveraging Electron, and we have modernized other products using this same approach.

Prior to the beginning of the merging of CPC and RDI, I managed 34 software analysts, developers, integrators, and QA engineers nationwide, along with the IT infrastructure group which manages our network, phone, servers, and other equipment at 4 sites. I have continuously mentored younger engineers and made it my mission to ensure they were prepared for the next challenge.

In my career at CPC/RDI, I have functioned as Project/Program Manager, Technical Manager, and Deputy Project/Program manager for several projects ranging from as small as $20,000 budget to $8 million budget. Most recently, I was Deputy Program Manager and Technical Lead for a $4.5 million per year multi-year contract consisting of up to 38 engineers, QA, field support, and trainers.
